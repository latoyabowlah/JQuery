	<h1>Taylor Swift Caught in Nicki Minaj's VMA Outrage</h1>

	<h2>Minaj calls out the MTV VMAs and “white media” for snub, racism, and conspiracy.</h2>

		<p>Apparently upset by missing out on a nomination for Video of the Year at the forthcoming MTV Video Music Awards, Nicki Minaj vented, as one does, on her Twitter account. </p>

		<p>Fellow pop titan Taylor Swift, as one of the only two women (the other being Beyoncé for "7/11") in the running for the award, for, ironically, “Bad Blood”, took the comment personally. Minaj played innocent: Huh? U must not be reading my tweets. Didn't say a word about u. I love u just as much. But u should speak on this.</p>

		<p>Swift acquiesced:If I win, please come up with me!! You're invited to any stage I'm ever on.</p>

		<p>A tentative peace made, Minaj took a couple swings at what she perceives as a racist media:Nothing I said had to do with Taylor. So what jabs? White media and their tactics. So sad. That's what they want.</p>
